# swdb
A software database, connecting file types with supporting programs. File types are tagged with PRONOM's unique id (PUID).
# Workflow
A corpus of example files is processed with FIDO to determine the PUID. In a second step the files are rendered/opened/processed on different operating systems with the listed software products. If it succeeds, the quality is rated. For more information see the comment section in swdb.xml
