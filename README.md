# swdb
A software database, linking file types to supporting programs. File types are tagged with PRONOM's unique id (PUID) (http://apps.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/Default.aspx).
# Workflow
A corpus of example files is processed with FIDO (http://openpreservation.org/technology/products/fido/) to determine the PUID. In a second step the files are rendered/opened/processed/edited on different operating systems with the listed software products. If it succeeds, the quality is rated. For more information see the comment section in swdb.xml
